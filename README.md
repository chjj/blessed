# blessed

A curses-like library for node.js.

Blessed was originally written to only support the xterm terminfo, but can
now parse and compile any terminfo to be completely portable accross all
terminals. See the `tput` example below.

Blessed also includes an extremely high-level widget library.

## Example Usage

This will actually parse the xterm terminfo and compile every
string capability to a javascript function:

``` js
var Tput = require('blessed').Tput
  , tput = Tput('xterm');

console.log(tput.setaf(4) + 'hello' + tput.sgr0());
```

To play around with it on the command line, it works just like tput:

``` bash
$ tput.js setaf 2
$ tput.js sgr0
$ echo "$(tput.js setaf 2)hello world$(tput.js sgr0)"
```

The main functionality is exposed in the main `blessed` module:

``` js
var blessed = require('blessed')
  , program = blessed();

program.on('keypress', function(ch, key) {
  if (key.name === 'q') {
    program.clear();
    program.disableMouse();
    program.showCursor();
    program.normalBuffer();
    process.exit(0);
  }
});

program.on('mouse', function(data) {
  if (data.action === 'mousemove') {
    program.move(data.x, data.y);
    program.bg('red');
    program.write('x');
    program.bg('!red');
  }
});

program.alternateBuffer();
program.enableMouse();
program.hideCursor();
program.clear();

program.move(1, 1);
program.bg('black');
program.write('Hello world', 'blue fg');
program.setx((program.cols / 2 | 0) - 4);
program.down(5);
program.write('Hi again!');
program.bg('!black');
program.feed();
```

## High-level Documentation

### Example

This will render a box with ascii borders containing the text 'Hello world!',
perfectly centered horizontally and vertically.

``` js
var blessed = require('blessed')
  , screen = new blessed.Screen;

var box = new blessed.Box({
  top: 'center',
  left: 'center',
  width: '50%',
  height: '50%',
  border: {
    type: 'ascii',
    fg: 'white'
  },
  fg: 'white',
  bg: 'magenta',
  content: 'Hello world!',
  tags: true
});

screen.append(box);

box.on('click', function(data) {
  box.setContent('{center}Some different {red-fg}content{/red-fg}.{/center}');
  screen.render();
});

screen.on('keypress', function(ch, key) {
  if (key.name === 'escape') {
    return process.exit(0);
  }
});

screen.render();
```

### Positioning

Offsets may be a number, a percentage (e.g. `50%`), or a keyword (e.g.
`center`).

Dimensions may be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `50%`).

Positions are treated almost *exactly* the same as they are in CSS/CSSOM when
an element has the `position: absolute` CSS property.

When an element is created, it can be given coordinates in its constructor:

``` js
var box = new blessed.Box({
  left: 'center',
  top: 'center',
  bg: 'yellow',
  width: '50%',
  height: '50%'
});
```

This tells blessed to create a box, perfectly centered **relative to its
parent**, 50% as wide and 50% as tall as its parent.

To access the calculated offsets, relative to the parent:

``` js
console.log(box.rleft);
console.log(box.rtop);
```

To access the calculated offsets, absolute (relative to the screen):

``` js
console.log(box.left);
console.log(box.top);
```

#### Overlapping offsets and dimensions greater than parents'

This still needs to be tested a bit, but it should work.

### Content

Every element can have text content via `setContent`. If `tags: true` was
passed to the element's constructor, the content can contain tags. For example:

```
box.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/bold}{/green-bg}{/red-fg}');
```

To make this more concise `{/}` cancels all character attributes.

```
box.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/}');
```

Newlines and alignment are also possible in content.

```
box.setContent('hello\n'
  + '{right}world{/right}\n'
  + '{center}foo{/center}');
```

This will produce a box that looks like:

```
| hello                 |
|                 world |
|          foo          |
```

Content can also handle SGR escape codes. This means if you got output from a
program, say `git log` for example, you can feed it directly to an element's
content and the colors will be parsed appropriately.

This means that while `{red-fg}foo{/red-fg}` produces `^[[31mfoo^[[39m`, you
could just feed `^[[31mfoo^[[39m` directly to the content.

### Rendering

To actually render the screen buffer, you must call `render`.

``` js
box.setContent('Hello world.');
screen.render();
```

Elements are rendered with the lower elements in the children array being
painted first. In terms of the painter's algorithm, the lowest indicies in the
array are the furthest away, just like in the DOM.

### Optimization and CSR

You may notice a lot of terminal apps (e.g. mutt, irssi, vim, ncmpcpp) don't
have sidebars, and only have "elements" that take up the entire width of the
screen. The reason for this is speed (and general cleanliness). VT-like
terminals have something called a CSR (change_scroll_region) code, as well as
IL (insert_line), and DL (delete_code) codes. Using these three codes, it is
possible to create a very efficient rendering by avoiding redrawing the entire
screen when a line is inserted or removed. Since blessed is extremely dynamic,
it is hard to do this optimization automatically (blessed assumes you may
create any element of any width in any position). So, there is a solution:

``` js
var box = new blessed.Box(...);
box.setContent('line 1\nline 2');
box.insertBottom('line 3');
box.insertBottom('line 4');
box.insertTop('line 0');
```

If your element has the same width as the screen, the line insertion will be
optimized by using a combination CSR/IL/DL codes. These methods may be made
smarter in the future to detect whether any elements are being overlapped to
the sides.

Outputting:

```
| line 0            |
| line 1            |
| line 2            |
| line 3            |
| line 4            |
```
