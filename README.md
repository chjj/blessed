# blessed

A curses-like library with a high level terminal interface API for node.js.

![blessed](https://raw.github.com/chjj/blessed/master/img/screenshot.png)

Blessed is over 16,000 lines of code and terminal goodness. It's completely
implemented in javascript, and its goal consists of two things:

1. Reimplement ncurses entirely by parsing and compiling terminfo and termcap,
and exposing a `Program` object which can output escape sequences compatible
with _any_ terminal.

2. Implement a widget API which is heavily optimized for terminals.

The blessed renderer makes use of CSR (change-scroll-region), and BCE
(back-color-erase). It draws the screen using the painter's algorithm and is
sped up with smart cursor movements and a screen damage buffer. This means
rendering of your application will be extremely efficient: blessed only draws
the changes (damage) to the screen.

Blessed is arguably as accurate as ncurses, but even more optimized in some
ways. The widget library gives you an API which is reminiscent of the DOM.
Anyone is able to make an awesome terminal application with blessed. There are
terminal widget libraries for other platforms (primarily python and perl), but
blessed is the most DOM-like.

Blessed has been used to implement other popular libraries and programs.
Examples include: the [slap text editor][slap] and [blessed-contrib][contrib].
The blessed API itself has gone on to inspire [termui][termui] for Go.

## Install

``` bash
$ npm install blessed
```

## Example

This will render a box with line borders containing the text `'Hello world!'`,
perfectly centered horizontally and vertically.

__NOTE__: It is recommend you use either `smartCSR` or `fastCSR` as a
`blessed.screen` option. `autoPadding` is also recommended; it will
automatically offset box content within borders instead of on top of them when
coords are `0`. non-`autoPadding` _may_ be deprecated in the future. See the
API documentation for further explanation of these options.

``` js
var blessed = require('blessed');

// Create a screen object.
var screen = blessed.screen({
  autoPadding: true,
  smartCSR: true
});

screen.title = 'my window title';

// Create a box perfectly centered horizontally and vertically.
var box = blessed.box({
  top: 'center',
  left: 'center',
  width: '50%',
  height: '50%',
  content: 'Hello {bold}world{/bold}!',
  tags: true,
  border: {
    type: 'line'
  },
  style: {
    fg: 'white',
    bg: 'magenta',
    border: {
      fg: '#f0f0f0'
    },
    hover: {
      bg: 'green'
    }
  }
});

// Append our box to the screen.
screen.append(box);

// Add a PNG icon to the box (X11 only)
var icon = blessed.image({
  parent: box,
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
  width: 'shrink',
  height: 'shrink',
  file: __dirname + '/my-program-icon.png'
});

// If our box is clicked, change the content.
box.on('click', function(data) {
  box.setContent('{center}Some different {red-fg}content{/red-fg}.{/center}');
  screen.render();
});

// If box is focused, handle `enter`/`return` and give us some more content.
box.key('enter', function(ch, key) {
  box.setContent('{right}Even different {black-fg}content{/black-fg}.{/right}\n');
  box.setLine(1, 'bar');
  box.insertLine(1, 'foo');
  screen.render();
});

// Quit on Escape, q, or Control-C.
screen.key(['escape', 'q', 'C-c'], function(ch, key) {
  return process.exit(0);
});

// Focus our element.
box.focus();

// Render the screen.
screen.render();
```


## High-level Documentation

### Widgets

Blessed comes with a number of high-level widgets so you can avoid all the
nasty low-level terminal stuff.


#### Node (from EventEmitter)

The base node which everything inherits from.

##### Options:

- **screen** - the screen to be associated with.
- **parent** - the desired parent.
- **children** - an arrray of children.

##### Properties:

- inherits all from EventEmitter.
- **type** - type of the node (e.g. `box`).
- **options** - original options object.
- **parent** - parent node.
- **screen** - parent screen.
- **children** - array of node's children.
- **data, _, $** - an object for any miscellanous user data.
- **index** - render index (document order index) of the last render call.

##### Events:

- inherits all from EventEmitter.
- **adopt** - received when node is added to a parent.
- **remove** - received when node is removed from it's current parent.
- **reparent** - received when node gains a new parent.
- **attach** - received when node is attached to the screen directly or
  somewhere in its ancestry.
- **detach** - received when node is detached from the screen directly or
  somewhere in its ancestry.

##### Methods:

- inherits all from EventEmitter.
- **prepend(node)** - prepend a node to this node's children.
- **append(node)** - append a node to this node's children.
- **remove(node)** - remove child node from node.
- **insert(node, i)** - insert a node to this node's children at index `i`.
- **insertBefore(node, refNode)** - insert a node to this node's children
  before the reference node.
- **insertAfter(node, refNode)** - insert a node from node after the reference
  node.
- **detach()** - remove node from its parent.
- **emitDescendants(type, args..., [iterator])** - emit event for element, and
  recursively emit same event for all descendants.
- **get(name, [default])** - get user property with a potential default value.
- **set(name, value)** - set user property to value.


#### Screen (from Node)

The screen on which every other node renders.

##### Options:

- **program** - the blessed `Program` to be associated with. will be
  automatically instantiated if none is provided.
- **smartCSR** - attempt to perform CSR optimization on all possible elements
  (not just full-width ones, elements with uniform cells to their sides).
  this is known to cause flickering with elements that are not full-width,
  however, it is more optimal for terminal rendering.
- **fastCSR** - do CSR on any element within 20 cols of the screen edge on
  either side. faster than `smartCSR`, but may cause flickering depending on
  what is on each side of the element.
- **useBCE** - attempt to perform `back_color_erase` optimizations for terminals
  that support it. it will also work with terminals that don't support it, but
  only on lines with the default background color. as it stands with the current
  implementation, it's uncertain how much terminal performance this adds at the
  cost of overhead within node.
- **resizeTimeout** - amount of time (in ms) to redraw the screen after the
  terminal is resized (default: 300).
- **tabSize** - the width of tabs within an element's content.
- **autoPadding** - automatically position child elements with border and
  padding in mind (__NOTE__: this is a recommended option. it may become
  default in the future).
- **artificialCursor** - have blessed draw a custom cursor and hide the
  terminal cursor (__experimental__).
- **cursorShape** - shape of the artificial cursor. can be: block, underline,
  or line.
- **cursorBlink** - whether the artificial cursor blinks.
- **cursorColor** - color of the artificial color. accepts any valid color
  value (`null` is default).
- **log** - create a log file. see `log` method.
- **dump** - dump all output and input to desired file. can be used together
  with `log` option if set as a boolean.
- **debug** - debug mode. enables usage of the `debug` method.
- **ignoreLocked** - Array of keys in their full format (e.g. `C-c`) to ignore
  when keys are locked. Useful for creating a key that will *always* exit no
  matter whether the keys are locked.

- **tput** - the blessed Tput object (only available if you passed `tput: true`
  to the Program constructor.)

- **render** - received on render.

##### Methods:

### Artificial Cursors

Terminal cursors can be tricky. They all have different custom escape codes to
alter. As an _experimental_ alternative, blessed can draw a cursor for you,
allowing you to have a custom cursor that you control.

``` js
var screen = blessed.screen({
  artificialCursor: true,
  cursorShape: 'line',
  cursorBlink: true,
  cursorColor: null // null for default
});
```

That's it. It's controlled the same way as the regular cursor.


### Positioning

Offsets may be a number, a percentage (e.g. `50%`), or a keyword (e.g.
`center`).

Dimensions may be a number, or a percentage (e.g. `50%`).

Positions are treated almost *exactly* the same as they are in CSS/CSSOM when
an element has the `position: absolute` CSS property.

When an element is created, it can be given coordinates in its constructor:

``` js
var box = blessed.box({
  left: 'center',
  top: 'center',
  bg: 'yellow',
  width: '50%',
  height: '50%'
});
```

This tells blessed to create a box, perfectly centered **relative to its
parent**, 50% as wide and 50% as tall as its parent.

To access the calculated offsets, relative to the parent:

``` js
console.log(box.rleft);
console.log(box.rtop);
```

To access the calculated offsets, absolute (relative to the screen):

``` js
console.log(box.left);
console.log(box.top);
```

#### Overlapping offsets and dimensions greater than parents'

This still needs to be tested a bit, but it should work.


### Content

Every element can have text content via `setContent`. If `tags: true` was
passed to the element's constructor, the content can contain tags. For example:

```
box.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/bold}{/green-bg}{/red-fg}');
```

To make this more concise `{/}` cancels all character attributes.

```
box.setContent('hello {red-fg}{green-bg}{bold}world{/}');
```

Newlines and alignment are also possible in content.

``` js
box.setContent('hello\n'
  + '{right}world{/right}\n'
  + '{center}foo{/center}');
```

This will produce a box that looks like:

```
| hello                 |
|                 world |
|          foo          |
```

Content can also handle SGR escape codes. This means if you got output from a
program, say `git log` for example, you can feed it directly to an element's
content and the colors will be parsed appropriately.

This means that while `{red-fg}foo{/red-fg}` produces `^[[31mfoo^[[39m`, you
could just feed `^[[31mfoo^[[39m` directly to the content.


### Event Bubbling

Events can bubble in blessed. For example:

Receiving all click events for `box`:

``` js
box.on('click', function(mouse) {
  box.setContent('You clicked ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');
  screen.render();
});
```

Receiving all click events for `box`, as well as all of its children:

``` js
box.on('element click', function(el, mouse) {
  box.setContent('You clicked '
    + el.type + ' at ' + mouse.x + ', ' + mouse.y + '.');
  screen.render();
  if (el === box) {
    return false; // Cancel propagation.
  }
});
```

`el` gets passed in as the first argument. It refers to the target element the
event occurred on. Returning `false` will cancel propagation up the tree.


### Rendering

To actually render the screen buffer, you must call `render`.

``` js
box.setContent('Hello world.');
screen.render();
```

Elements are rendered with the lower elements in the children array being
painted first. In terms of the painter's algorithm, the lowest indicies in the
array are the furthest away, just like in the DOM.


### Windows compatibility

Currently there is no `mouse` or `resize` event support on Windows.

Windows users will need to explicitly set `term` when creating a screen like so
(**NOTE**: This is no longer necessary as of the latest versions of blessed.
This is now handled automatically):

``` js
var screen = blessed.screen({ term: 'windows-ansi' });
```


### Testing

Most tests contained in the `test/` directory are interactive. It's up to the
programmer to determine whether the test is properly displayed. In the future
it might be better to do something similar to vttest.


## Lower-Level Usage

This will actually parse the xterm terminfo and compile every
string capability to a javascript function:

``` js
var blessed = require('blessed')
  , tput = blessed.tput('xterm-256color');

console.log(tput.setaf(4) + 'hello' + tput.sgr0());
```

To play around with it on the command line, it works just like tput:

``` bash
$ tput.js setaf 2
$ tput.js sgr0
$ echo "$(tput.js setaf 2)hello world$(tput.js sgr0)"
```

The main functionality is exposed in the main `blessed` module:

``` js
var blessed = require('blessed')
  , program = blessed.program();

program.key('q', function(ch, key) {
  program.clear();
  program.disableMouse();
  program.showCursor();
  program.normalBuffer();
  process.exit(0);
});

program.on('mouse', function(data) {
  if (data.action === 'mousemove') {
    program.move(data.x, data.y);
    program.bg('red');
    program.write('x');
    program.bg('!red');
  }
});

program.alternateBuffer();
program.enableMouse();
program.hideCursor();
program.clear();

program.move(1, 1);
program.bg('black');
program.write('Hello world', 'blue fg');
program.setx((program.cols / 2 | 0) - 4);
program.down(5);
program.write('Hi again!');
program.bg('!black');
program.feed();
```


## FAQ

1. Why doesn't the Linux console render lines correctly on Ubuntu?
   - You need to install the `ncurses-base` package __and__ the `ncurses-term`
     package. (#98)
2. Why do vertical lines look chopped up in iTerm2?
   - All ACS vertical lines look this way in iTerm2.
3. Why can't I use my mouse in Terminal.app?
   - Terminal.app does not support mouse events.
4. Why doesn't the Image element appear in my terminal?
   - The Image element uses w3m to display images. This generally only works on
     X11+xterm/urxvt, but it *may* work on other unix terminals.
5. Why can't my mouse clicks register beyond 255-287 cells?
   - Older versions of VTE do not support any modern mouse protocol. On top of
     that, the old x10 protocol it does implement is bugged. Through several
     workarounds we've managed to get the cell limit from 127 to 255/287. If
     you're not happy with this, you may want to look into using xterm or
     urxvt, or a terminal which uses a modern VTE, like gnome-terminal.
6. Is blessed efficient?
   - Yes. Blessed implements CSR and uses the painter's algorithm to render the
     screen. It maintains two screen buffers so it only needs to render what
     has changed on the terminal screen.
7. Will blessed work with all terminals?
   - Yes. blessed has a terminfo/termcap parser and compiler that was written
     from scratch. It should work with every terminal as long as a terminfo
     file is provided. If you notice any compatibility issues in your termial,
     do not hesitate to post an issue.
8. What is "curses" and "ncurses"?
   - ["curses"][curses] was an old library written in the early days of unix
     which allowed a programmer to not have to worry about terminal
     compatibility. ["ncurses"][ncurses] is a free reimplementation of curses.
     It improved upon it quite a bit and is now the standard library for
     implementing terminal programs. Blessed uses neither of these, and instead
     handles terminal compatibility itself.
9. What is the difference between blessed and blessed-contrib?
   - blessed is a major piece of code which reimplements curses from the ground
     up. A UI API is then layered on top of this. blessed-contrib is a popular
     library built on top of blessed which makes clever use of modules to
     implement useful widgets like graphs, ascii art, and so on.
